# 1. Have you visited the documentation?

- No? Look for your answer [here](https://instructor-support.datacamp.com/)

- Yes, but I didn't find my answer. Move onto step 2

# 2. Is your question a Content question or a Product question?

- Do you have a question related to course management, course design, the content dashboard, etc.? Move onto step 3.

- Do you think you've found a bug in our editor or have a feature to request? This is a Product question. To report a bug or a request a feature, log into your course and start a new conversation using the Intercom widget. This will put you in direct content with our Product Manager and Engineering teams.
